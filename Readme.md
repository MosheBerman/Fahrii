Welcome to the Fahrii (like Safari, without the "Sa") project. If you've heard of GreasePocket, then you know what this is.

Fahrii is an attempt to bring userscripts to the Safari Mobile. 

I've put together the iPhone browser but it's rather crude and needs a lot of polish. Right now, 
Fahrii can read userscripts out of the Documents directory and inject thim into the page but it does 
not sandbox them at all.

Please look at the Issues to see what needs to be done. Then, if you want to contribute, kindly fork 
this repository and work on one issue at a time. when you are done, make a pull request. 

Thanks for stopping by and I hope you can help!
